# Road-Accident-Analysis
This project presents a Road Accidents Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel with Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Data Analysis techniques. The dashboard dynamically visualizes accident data from 2021-2022, allowing users to interactively filter insights by accident date, location type (Urban/Rural), and other key factors.
